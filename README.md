The project Student_Attendance_System contains the following key components:

Java source files (.java) and compiled files (.class):

Main.java — likely the entry point of the application.

Student.java — defines student attributes and behaviors.

Teacher.java — defines teacher attributes and behaviors.

User.java — a base class for Student and Teacher.

Attendance.java — handles attendance records.

AttendanceService.java — service class for managing attendance operations.

README.md — an existing readme (we will create a fully finished version).

.git directory — contains git metadata for version control.

The project is console-based in Java.

Here’s a fully finished README suitable for GitHub:

# Student Attendance System

A console-based **Student Attendance System** developed in Java. This project allows teachers to manage student attendance and students to view their attendance records. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and service-based architecture.

## Features

- **Student Management**
  - View personal information
  - Check attendance records

- **Teacher Management**
  - Add or remove attendance records for students
  - View attendance of students

- **Attendance Tracking**
  - Record attendance for each student by date
  - Manage multiple students and classes

- **Object-Oriented Design**
  - `User` base class with `Student` and `Teacher` subclasses
  - `AttendanceService` for handling attendance operations

If you want, I can also **update this README** to include **sample screenshots of console usage**, **example commands**, and **detailed class interactions** to make it more professional for GitHub. This would fully showcase your project.
